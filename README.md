Example: "Hello", 'World', "12345"

Boolean (bool):

Represents one of two values: True or False.
Example: True, False

List (list):

An ordered collection of items, which can be of mixed data types.
Example: [1, 2, 3], ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], [1, "hello", 3.14]

Tuple (tuple):

An ordered collection of items similar to lists, but immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
Example: (1, 2, 3), ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

Dictionary (dict):

An unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Example: {"name": "John", "age": 30}, {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "cherry": 3}

Set (set):

An unordered collection of unique items.
Example: {1, 2, 3}, {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

Demonstration of how to create and use variables of different data types.

# Integer
my_int = 10
print(f"Integer: {my_int}, Type: {type(my_int)}")

# Float
my_float = 3.14
print(f"Float: {my_float}, Type: {type(my_float)}")

# String
my_str = "Hello, World!"
print(f"String: {my_str}, Type: {type(my_str)}")

# Boolean
my_bool = True
print(f"Boolean: {my_bool}, Type: {type(my_bool)}")

# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0]
print(f"List: {my_list}, Type: {type(my_list)}")

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0)
print(f"Tuple: {my_tuple}, Type: {type(my_tuple)}")

# Dictionary
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Wonderland"}
print(f"Dictionary: {my_dict}, Type: {type(my_dict)}")

# Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, "apple"}
print(f"Set: {my_set}, Type: {type(my_set)}")


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.

Example of an if -else statemant
 # Example of if-else statement
                                       age = 18

                                       if age >= 18:
                                          print("You are an adult.")
                                       else:
                                          print("You are a minor.")

# Example of a for loop
                                       fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

                                       for fruit in fruits:
                                          print(fruit)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, modular pieces, making your code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain. Functions also promote code reusability and abstraction.

# Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum

                                       def calculate_sum(a=2, b=5):
                                          return a + b

                                       result = calculate_sum(a=2, b=5)
                                       print("Sum:", result)  


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

# Lists (list):

Ordered collection of items.
Accessed by index.
Mutable (can be changed).
Can contain duplicate values.
Syntax: [item1, item2, item3, ...]

# Dictionaries (dict):

Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Accessed by key.
Mutable (can be changed).
Keys are unique within a dictionary, but values can be duplicated.
Syntax: {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3, ...}

# SCRIPT
# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

# Demonstrate basic operations on the list
numbers.append(6)
numbers.sort() 
numbers.pop(1) 

# Demonstrate basic operations on the dictionary
my_dict['country'] = 'USA'
my_dict.pop('age') 
print(my_dict)


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully manage and respond to errors that occur during program execution.

# Example of exception handling

                           num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
                           num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

                           result = num1 / num2  

                           print(f"Result of division: {result}")

                        except ValueError:
                        
                           print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

                        except ZeroDivisionError:
                        
                           print("Error: Division by zero!")

                        finally:
                           
                           print("Execution of the program has completed.")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

A module in Python is a file containing Python code that defines functions, classes, and variables which can be reused across different programs. Modules help organize code logically and promote reusability. Any Python file can be considered a module, and its name is the name of the file without the .py extension.

Packages
A package is a collection of modules organized in directories that provide a hierarchical structure. Packages allow for a well-organized and scalable project structure. A package typically contains an __init__.py file to indicate that the directory should be treated as a package. The __init__.py file can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.

# Importing and Using a Module
To use the functionalities provided by a module, you need to import it into your script using the import statement.

# Example Using the math Module
The math module is a built-in Python module that provides mathematical functions and constants.

import math
result= math.sqrt(25)
print(result) 

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

    To read the contents of a file, you can use the open() function with the 'r' mode (read mode), followed by methods like read(), readline(), or readlines().

    # Script that reads content
    # Script to read the content of a file and print it to the console

# Open the file in read mode

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
print(content)

# Writing a file 

lines = ["Hello, World!", "This is a test.", "Writing to a file in Python."]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')
print(lines
)
